The BRFSS, which began in 1984, is a collaboration between US states, territories, and the CDC, and conducts an annual state-level telephone survey system. The primary goal is to gather information on a range of health-related risk behaviors, preventive health practices, and access to health care with special emphasis on chronic illness and injuries. Both landline and cell phone numbers were used to interview people 18 years of age and older for the study. In 2020, BRFSS assessed various health aspects and thus the dataset contains range of indicators for general well-being, the number of healthy days, health care expenses, the incidence of heart diseases or heart attacks, adequacy of sleep, marital status, income and educational attainment of the respondents. 

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed using the following link.
